[07/08/2023 20:16] asselstine
The Grand prizes are for the whole tier 0 pot of liquidity, so when is awarded it‚Äôs cleared out

That being said- you have keen eyes.  This is an older chart from an earlier version of the algorithm that only allowed one prize per user per tier per vault.  That‚Äôs been changed (with the prize index), so we should see more variance in the prize sizes for mid tiers.

I was pressed for time so I don‚Äôt have an updated chart, but I believe it still illustrates the relative variance nicely


[07/08/2023 20:22] fabienmorrow
sry it's still unclear for me. How a Ti can decrease without reaching zero ? How a bucket can be partially emptied ? If someone won and the prize is claimed, the Ti is emptied no ?


[07/08/2023 20:24] asselstine
For the grand prize yes because the prize size is the whole bucket of liquidity


[07/08/2023 20:24] asselstine
For other tiers the liquidity is split across 4^t prizes, which will have statistical variance


[07/08/2023 20:25] asselstine
For the daily prizes, this may be higher.  This is why we have the reserve to act as a second reservoir of liquidity

Prize Pool | PoolTogether
In PoolTogether V5 prizes are distributed through the Prize Pool contract. There is one Prize Pool deployed on each chain on which PT is deployed. The Prize Pool receives POOL tokens from Vaults, and releases the tokens as prizes in daily Draws. In this way, prize liquidity is isolated to a chain.


[07/08/2023 22:19] fabienmorrow

Hey @Brendan üåäüèÜ @trmid @Dylan 
I have a question about the Vault's owners... As for the scope of this audit, how should we treat those owners?
- Trusted entities, restricted entities?

From the video, I understood that each vault will have its own owner.., and vaults can be created permissionless....

If we identify ways that vault owners can abuse their privilege and cause harm to the users, is this something you are interested in?


[07/09/2023 05:00] asselstine
Would love to hear about that.

This is new territory for us.  Our goal is that some degree of behavior is guaranteed by using the standard PoolTogether vault, but at the end of the day if someone makes a token that rugs there is nothing the protocol can do.

That being said, identifying the possible ingress points means that we‚Äôll know what to look for.  We won‚Äôt be going in blind.

So I encourage you to think outside the box; put that adversarial hat on and see how you can find a way in.

hey team! got a question, what is the yieldVault? I see the "regular" vaults are depositing there, is it kind of intermediate vault where the vault yield is stored before being sent to prize pool, or how does it work?


[07/09/2023 06:35] 0xstalin
@Brendan üåäüèÜ Just wondering what would happen if the repos that are being referenced on the code4rena repo are updated during the contest & judging phases?

For example, If I report an issue on line 50 on the Vault contract (https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L50), and then the repo is updated and some lines are added/removed, when the judges look at the links I used as a reference, would the updates affect the links, or updates are pushed and new links are created...? How does that work? Or the repos won't be updated at all?

its pointed in the comments that it is an another vault, that's why I understood that there are in fact two vaults, the entry one and the "yield earning" one where the funds are deposited at the end

Vaults are 4626 compatible, and they use an underlying 4626 compatible yield source


[07/09/2023 07:54] asselstine
Our vaults are a gamification layer on top of regular 4626 yield


[07/09/2023 07:58] 0xarmedgoose
thanks! just if I understood properly, so the users are supposed to already be using some vaults,  and they/their procotol can add PoolTogether layer on it, which in this case means setting the yieldVault to the vault the user was previously using and thats how you integrate PT with the "old vault" right?

@Brendan üåäüèÜ could you explain more what is and how is `delegateBalance` used from `TWABController`?


[07/09/2023 18:11] asselstine
The twab controller tracks two balances: the balance that an account ‚Äúowns‚Äù and the balance that has been delegated to it


[07/09/2023 18:12] asselstine
The delegated balance is what is used for chance


[07/09/2023 18:13] asselstine
The ‚Äúowned‚Äù balance is the users ERC20 balance, essentially


[07/09/2023 18:13] asselstine
Hope that helps


[07/09/2023 18:13] proxy1967
so delegated is the one used you could say

The yield vault can be any 4626 compatible vault.  I thought it was intuitive but it seems we do need more docs!

There aren‚Äôt docs for the liquidator just yet; working on those this week

Thanks for the info.
Also, don't you guys have a chart/diagram of the whole architecture in detail? Like how tokens are deposited, how they generate yield through Aave, Compound, etc, how tokens can be withdrawn while they are lended to Aave.

Mine as well üôÇ


[07/10/2023 16:08] hasanza
As I understand it, this is the process:

User deposits Asset Token into `Vault`, `Vault` deposits this amount into `yieldVault`, `Vault` is minted yieldVaultShares by the yieldVault, while Vault mints VaultShares to the User .
yieldVault can be any ERC4626 compatible vault capable of generating yield.

@Brendan üåäüèÜ Please check your DM


[07/10/2023 16:49] asselstine
I'm seeing some confusion around how deposits are made into the Vault


[07/10/2023 16:49] asselstine
There are two ways of depositing into the Vault:

1. A contract can transfer USDC to the Vault then call the deposit() function to deposit the additional balance
2. A contract can approve a Vault allowance and call the deposit() function. The Vault will use safeTransferFrom to transfer-in the required tokens.


[07/10/2023 16:50] asselstine
This is our intention, at least. Let's see if you all can find issues.


[07/10/2023 21:05] hasanza
When a user deposits, do assets always leave the user's wallet and get transferred to the Vault (and then to the yieldVault from there)? If not, then why not?

The assets are always deposited into the Vault, yes <https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L959C49-L959C49>

@Brendan üåäüèÜ in `TwabLib` `increaseBalance` and `decreaseBalance` why is the criteria for `isObservationRecorded = _delegateAmount != uint96(0);`, and is there any other ?


[07/11/2023 05:42] asselstine
Good question for @Dylan


[07/11/2023 06:47] hasanza
Hmm, but then what about the comments at line at line 923 and 941, which say assets are only transferred from the user if there are not enough assets in the Vault. Shouldn't assets always be transferred from users to Vault, no matter the amount of assets in the Vault?

We only record a new Observation if the `delegateBalance` changes. No sense wasting gas when there's no change to the historic value. `_delegateAmount` is the amount to update the `delegateBalance` by.


[07/11/2023 13:40] dylandesrosier
Yes, everything within scope is chain agnostic

Maybe I am missing something but whats the point of a user calling ``mintYieldFee()`` in the Vault?


[07/11/2023 15:36] asselstine (pinned)
Hey folks, I know many are having an issue with this curious line: <https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L580>

The original developer is on vacation, but I reached out for an explanation.  **tldr; it's to prevent exchange rate manipulation. Here's what he said:**




It's explained in this comment: <https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L548>

Basically, we deposit into the YieldVault any amount of underlying assets that may be currently held by the Vault. This way when we _mint(), we ensure that the exchange rate is accurate.

Since the Liquidator is only aware of the _amountIn of Prize Tokens contributed: <https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-liquidator/blob/94230890139bc12d3f5c8a9cc0838a5c71a221d2/src/LiquidationRouter.sol#L70>

An attacker may try to manipulate the exchange rate by sending underlying assets directly to the Vault to inflate the amount of Vault shares received, that's why we have the following condition: _amountOut >= _vaultAssets

We should not mint more Vault shares than Prize Tokens contributed. 

The totalSupply and exchange rate will be updated once we _mint():
<https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1123>

So we don't want to deposit into the Yield Vault more underlying assets than the _amountOut of Vault shares minted since the exchange rate is the total amount of underlying assets withdrawable from the Yield Vault over the total supply of Vault shares:
<https://github.com/GenerationSoftware/pt-v5-vault/blob/b1deb5d494c25f885c34c83f014c8a855c5e2749/src/Vault.sol#L1183>

If we deposit more underlying assets than Vault shares minted, we would inflate the exchange rate.

The prize pool will get deployed only once, or there would be multiple prize pools?


[07/11/2023 16:41] 0xbtk
The Prize Pool is fully autonomous and immutable; there are no governance or admin controls. The contract adjusts the number of prizes automatically. https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/next/design/prize-pool

{Embed}
https://dev.pooltogether.com/protocol/next/design/prize-pool
Prize Pool | PoolTogether
In PoolTogether V5 prizes are distributed through the Prize Pool contract. There is one Prize Pool deployed on each chain on which PT is deployed. The Prize Pool receives POOL tokens from Vaults, and releases the tokens as prizes in daily Draws. In this way, prize liquidity is isolated to a chain.


[07/11/2023 16:59] dylandesrosier
1 Prize Pool : N Prize Vaults. The plan is to have 1 Prize Pool per chain.

[07/11/2023 20:00] trmid
afaik, this allows a contract to deposit funds with cheaper gas costs since it doesn't need an approval. A contract can send tokens to the vault and call `_deposit` all in the same tx.

Does this means for an address to participate to a prize, this address needs to delegate its balance to itself ?

Yes, but an address' default delegate is itself.

I'm not doing the audit but I'm really interested by the code, something I dont understand yet is why is there a global prizeTokenPerShare and also a prizeTokenPerShare for each Tiers struct ?


[07/13/2023 01:28] alymurtazamemon
@trmid `MAX_CARDINALITY` shouldn't be 365 in all places?


[07/13/2023 05:51] praise95
@Brendan üåäüèÜ boss who is supposed to call PrizePool.claimPrize(), is it vault or normal users?


[07/13/2023 06:53] devdacian
my understanding is the Vault is supposed to call PrizePool.claimPrize(). You can see that when  PrizePool.claimPrize() calls other functions, it passes msg.sendern for the vault address parameter of those other functions, so if someone who isn't a vault calls it those checks will fail & the call to _isWinner() for example will return false

[07/13/2023 06:54] praise95
Okay, thanks


[07/13/2023 11:10] dylandesrosier
The max cardinality depends on the use case - they shouldn't have to line up across the whole system.


[07/13/2023 11:12] dylandesrosier
The global amount is calculated then set on each tier every draw. The amounts per tier are updated throughout the draw to track claims from those tiers.
